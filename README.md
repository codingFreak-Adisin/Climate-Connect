# Climate-Connect
This project is made to be submitted to a hackathon named - Xd Climate Hackathon

This project was made using simple html, css and javascript. Our main moto to create this project was to spread awareness among people of small age group, about climate change. This is a small educational website, which focuses on a quiz, which students can take and get the deeper knowledge of every question, even if they get the wrong answer. We have even created a youtube playlist, which will help them to learn more about climate change, in a visual way. The videos were made by one our team mate. 

I hope you like our project :)
